" use vim-airline you need this:
let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1
" This is disabled by default; add the following to your vimrc to enable the extension:
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#enabled = 1
" Separators can be configured independently for the tabline, so here is how you can define "straight" tabs:
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#left_sep = ' '
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#left_alt_sep = '|'

" In addition, you can also choose which path formatter airline uses. This affects how file paths are displayed in each individual tab as well as the current buffer indicator in the upper right. To do so, set the formatter field with:
let g:airline#extensions#tabline#formatter = 'default'
