" How can I open a NERDTree automatically when vim starts up if no files were specified?
autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 0 && !exists("s:std_in") | NERDTree | endif
"Stick this in your vimrc to open NERDTree with F1 (you can set whatever key you want):
map <F1> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
